                <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                <p>Tic-Tac-Toe Bolt is similar to regular Tic-Tac-Toe, but with a twist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>X plays first</strong> (traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rule)</li>
                    <li>Players take turns placing their marks (O or X) on a 3×3 grid</li>
                    <li>The goal is to get 3 marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)</li>
                    <li><strong>Special rule:</strong> After placing your 4th mark, your oldest mark disappears</li>
                    <li>Each player can have a maximum of 3 marks on the board at any time</li>
                    <li>Marks disappear after 6 half-moves (3 full turns)</li>
                    <li>This creates a dynamic game where marks constantly vanish and reappear!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>About the AI: Retrograde Analysis & Game Theory</h2>
                <p>The AI opponent in Tic-Tac-Toe Bolt uses <strong>retrograde analysis</strong>, a powerful technique from game theory and chess programming. Unlike traditional minimax algorithms that search forward, retrograde analysis works backwards from terminal positions (wins, losses, draws) to determine the optimal strategy for every possible game state.</p>
                
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>This is a <strong>zero-sum game</strong> where one player's gain is the other's loss. The AI:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Precomputes all game states:</strong> Every possible board configuration with different vanish counts is analyzed</li>
                    <li><strong>Uses Bellman equations:</strong> For states with cycles, the AI calculates "moves to end" using fixed-point iteration, ensuring consistent distance values even when the game graph contains loops</li>
                    <li><strong>Selects optimal moves:</strong> From any position, the AI chooses moves that either win fastest (when winning) or lose slowest (when losing), assuming optimal play from both sides</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Why It's Unbeatable</h3>
                <p>Since all game states are precomputed, the AI knows the outcome of every possible move sequence. It will never make a mistake that leads to a loss when a draw or win was possible. This makes it a <strong>perfect player</strong> - the best you can hope for is a draw if you play optimally.</p>
                
                <h3>AI Difficulty</h3>
                <p><strong>When the AI plays as X (first player):</strong> The AI will always win or draw. Since X has the advantage of going first, the AI can force a win or at least secure a draw with perfect play.</p>
                <p><strong>When the AI plays as O (second player):</strong> You have a chance to win! While the AI still plays perfectly, playing as X gives you the first-move advantage. If you play optimally, you can potentially secure a victory against the AI.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Challenge yourself:</strong> Can you achieve a draw (or even a win when playing as X) against this perfect AI? The game's dynamic nature (disappearing marks) adds strategic depth beyond traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, making each game unique and challenging.</p>
